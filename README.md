# HeyURL! Code Challenge

## HeyURL! Code Challenge 

This repository has been created as a code challenge for candidates with
FullStack Labs. The candidate will clone and setup an existing Spring
MVC application. The application will contain routes, models, and
minimal views but with no actual functionality created. The candidate
will show all their expertise building apps with the Spring MVC
framework and problem solving skills.


## Overview

HeyURL! is a service to create awesome friendly URLs to make it easier
for people to remember. Our team developed some mockup views but don't
have our awesome functionality in place yet.


## Requirements

See [CHALLENGE.md] for the parameters of the challenge.


## Getting Started

1. Clone repository

2. Install JDK 12+

3. Run the server:
   ```./mvnw spring-boot:run```


## Considerations

1. Check controller actions in `src/main/java/co/fullstacklabs/heyurl/controllers`
1. Check views in `src/main/resources/templates`
1. Google Charts is already added to display charts, but you can use any library
